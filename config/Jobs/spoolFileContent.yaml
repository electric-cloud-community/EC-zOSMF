      SSS-EEE
      where SSS identifies the start record and EEE identifies the end record to be retrieved. Both values are relative offsets (0-based). When EEE is set to 0, records through the end of the spool file are retrieved.

      where SSS identifies the start record and NNN identifies the number of records to be retrieved.</pre>

      The z/OS jobs REST interface translates records from the server codepage to the client codepage and returns the records with Content-Type: plain/text. Trailing spaces are removed and newline characters are used as record separators. This value is the default if you omit the mode parameter.

      The z/OS jobs REST interface performs no translation and returns the records with Content-Type: application/octet-stream.
